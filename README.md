# Project Description
"My laundry" website is responsible for receiving and delivering clothes to customers after the selected laundry, chosen by the customer, performs the requested services. The website displays a list of laundries closest to the customers' locations. Laundries can showcase their services on the website to allow customers to choose suitable services. Drivers will pick up clothes from customers and deliver them to the laundry, then return them.

The website includes various features such as: easily displaying nearby laundries to the customer's location, in addition to ordering services from the laundry with ease. It also enables order tracking, rating both the laundry and the driver, and adding comments upon receiving the order.
